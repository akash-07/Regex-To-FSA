# Regex-To-FSA
Repository to transform Regex into Finite State Automata and Optimal forms of FSA. The features of Haskell that we are trying to highlight using this project are polymorphism, type classes, higher order functions and modularization. The pattern matching capability of Haskell is the feature that we use the most to match with the correct expression.

 - **Load the file.**
      ```haskell
      ghci> :l regExpToNFA.hs
      ```
 - **Type in the regular expression as shown. (Inside the code itself)** 
     ```haskell
     reg = (a*b)* -> Star (Then (Star (Literal 'a')) (Literal 'b') ) 
     reg = (ab | a*) -> Or ((Then (Literal 'a') (Literal 'b'))  (Star (Literal 'a')) )
     ```
- **Then type as follows.**
     ```haskell
     ghci> printNFA (build reg)
     ``` 
- **Example.**   
     ```haskell
      reg = (a*b)*
     *Main> printNFA (build reg)
      States:
      [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

       Moves:
       Move 3 'a' 4
       Move 6 'b' 7
       EMove 0 1
       EMove 0 9
       EMove 1 2
       EMove 2 3
       EMove 2 5
       EMove 4 3
       EMove 4 5
       EMove 5 6
       EMove 7 8
       EMove 8 1
       EMove 8 9

       Start State:
       0

       Final States:
       [9]
     ```
     
     **Opening the dot file.**
The dot file so generated can be viewed in following ways :

 1.   Convert it to .png/jpg using any online converter
 2.   Download GraphViz software and use gvedit
 3.   If you use linux, you can install graphviz using apt and then do the following 
         i. dot -Tpng out.dot > out.png (If the output file name is "out.dot") 
         ii. display out.png

In this way you finally get the image of DFA. You can define the delta function as per your transitions in the finite automata.
